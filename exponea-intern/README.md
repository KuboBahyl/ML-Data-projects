# Exponea internship assignment solution

Hello,
I created this Github in purpose to present my solution of Exponea internship assignment. The content of this repo:

* **assignment.pdf** - task description as I've been told via email
* **solution.py** - main python file of working solution
* **solution.ipynb** - iPython interactive notebook of the same solution
* **report.pdf** - report for non-programmers of task solution
* **src** - folder with data

To clone this repo, use:

`git clone git@github.com:KuboBahyl/Exponea-assignment.git`

## TLDR keywords:

Analyzing customer churn dataset, creating predictive models and suggest improvements.

## Nice-to-read solution:

Just open `solution.ipynb` directly in Github. Thank to developers, an environment is already set up and you should see compiled Python with all comments and visualizations.

If interested in interacting, clone the repo and open the `.ipynb` file using any Jupyter server with Python3 kernel.

## Pipelined solution:

Clone the repo and run the main file:

`python3 solution.py -f src/churn.*`

A clear output with models results should appear.

## Report:

If not interested in seeing python scripts, just read the `report.pdf`, where I tried to cover solution in as many non-programming way, as possible.
