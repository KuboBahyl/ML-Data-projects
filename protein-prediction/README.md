# Protein ligandibility prediction

Aim of this project was to apply the strongest ML methods to predict ligandibility of proteins based on their physical and chemical properties. Proteins data were obtained from (public) PDB database.

Used methods: *DT, Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVMs*

Used R language framework: *Caret*

Open file `proteins_Caret.R` to read the codebase. Check `report_extended.pdf` to read the summary.
